Introduction
In machine learning workflows, the Pipeline class from Scikit-Learn is invaluable for streamlining data preprocessing and model training into a single, coherent sequence.
A pipeline is essentially a sequence of data transformers that culminates with an optional final predictor.
This structure enables seamless integration of preprocessing and predictive modeling, ensuring that the same data transformations applied during training are consistently applied to new data during prediction.

Each intermediate step in a pipeline must be a transformer, meaning it should implement both fit and transform methods.
The final step, which is typically a predictive model, or estimator, only requires a fit method.
The entire pipeline can be trained simultaneously using a method like GridSearchCV, resulting in self-contained predictor that can be used to make predictions on unseen data.

Importantly, the pipeline allows you to set the parameters of each of these steps using their names and parameter names connected by a double underscore __.
For example, if a pipeline step is named imputer and you want to change its strategy, you can pass a parameter like imputer__strategy='median'.
Additionally, steps can be entirely swapped out by assigning a different estimator or even bypassed by setting them to 'passthrough' or None.

A major advantage of using a pipeline is that it enables comprehensive cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for all steps simultaneously.
By integrating the pipeline within GridSearchCV, you can fine-tune not only the model but also the preprocessing steps, leading to optimized overall performance.
Pipelines are essential for scenarios where preprocessing involves estimators performing operations like scaling, encoding categorical variables, imputing missing values, and dimensionality reduction.
Pipelines ensure these steps are reproducibly applied to both training and test data.

#TUNING HYPERPARAMETERS to make a better model:

"""
We created a model but haven't yet attempted to optimize its performance.
Let's see if we can do better. Recall that it would be a mistake to keep running the model over and over again with different hyperparamters to find the best one.
You would effectively be overfiiting the model to your test data set.
The correct way to handle this tuning is to use cross validation.
Using same dataset:
